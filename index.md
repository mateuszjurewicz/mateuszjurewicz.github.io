<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am an ML Engineer and AI Researcher interested in safely deploying AI models to help understand and solve real-world challenges. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/Research/Departments/Computer-Science-Department), where I was advised by [Professor Leon Derczynski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leon-derczynski/) as well as [Professor Graham Taylor](https://www.gwtaylor.ca/) during a research stay abroad in Canada at the [Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and the [University of Guelph's Machine Learning Research Group](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ceps/).


My research lies at the intersection of cutting edge <b>generative models</b> (LLMs) and <b>reinforcement learning</b> - with a special focus on building intelligent systems that are multimoda, scalable and interpretable. My research interests include <b>technical AI safety</b>, <b>mechanistic interpretability</b> and <b>scalable oversight</b>. My industry experience spans both start-ups & scale-ups such as [Tjek A/S](https://tjek.com/) and large tech companies such as [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html).
